  我在你們今天的此時此刻向你們問好，日安！ I'll say good day to you this day of your time, how are you all?

  好的 alright

  好的，謝謝！ all right, thank you

  首先我們再次感謝你們每個人和你們所有人一起共同創造了這次互動 first and foremost we will once again thank each and every one of you individually and all of you together collectively for the co-creation of this interaction

  並允許讓這場傳訊在你們這一天進行 and the allowance of this transmission this day of your time

  每次你們給予我們機會與你們每一個人互動 every single time you offer us an opportunity to interact with each and every one of you

  這是給我們的禮物 it is a gift for us

  所以我們感謝你們分享了這份禮物 so we thank you for that sharing for that gift

  在這場傳訊中，我們已經把它命名為「七個中性的需求」 in this transmission which we have titled the seven neutral needs

  我們想這樣開始 we would like to begin this way

  你們星球上很多人都和我們談論過，當他們發現自己處於某種境遇時 now many people on your planet have discussed with us that when they find themselves in certain circumstances

  他們並不一定知道「他們在生活中需要什麼」和他們經常會說的「他們在生活中想要什麼」之間的區別they do not necessarily know the difference between what it is they need in life and what it is that they often say that they want in life

  在「你需要什麼」的能量和「你想要什麼"的能量之間有著很大的不同 there is a big difference between the idea of​​ the energy of what you need and what you may want

  有時候它們可以是相同的 now sometimes sometimes they might coincide

  如果你走運的話 if you get lucky

  但是很多時候你想要的往往可能是你被教導去相信那是你需要的產物 but the idea is that many times what you want might often be the product of what you've been taught to believe you need

  那或許並不是你生活中真正需要的東西 that may not actually be what you really need in life

  你想要的有時候是 and what you want can sometimes

  因為那些信念系統或許是基於恐懼的，或許是負面的 because of those belief systems that might be either fear-based or negative

  你想要的是消極的小我認為需要控制的東西 be something that the negative ego thinks it needs to be in control of

  它需要吸引進你的生活中，以使你的生活得以滿足 it needs to attract into your life in order for your life to be fulfilled

  但要明白的是，當你允許生活順其自然時，生活會自動運轉 but the thing to understand is that life works automatically when you allow it to

  你真正需要的一切東西都會在完美的時機降臨到你身上 and everything you truly need will come to you in perfect timing

  這是一個自動的機制 it's an automatic mechanism

  想要某個東西，我們理解你們的意思 the idea of​​ wanting something we understand that the way you mean it

  我們理解這是你們常用的方式 we understand that the way you often use it

  但是當你過於強調它的時候 but when you put too much emphasis behind it

  要像你預想的那樣必鬚髮生 as being something that must happen in the way you have envisioned it happening

  實際上通常你是在限制自己 very often you're actually limiting yourself

  限制它本可以比你想像的要更偉大的方式發生 and limiting the way it could happen much greater than you imagined

  因為就像我們說的，物質頭腦在想像事物的方式上是有限的 because the physical mind as we have said is limited in its way of imagining things

  從某種意義上，高我可以想像到更多 the higher mind in a sense can imagine more

  所以當物質頭腦想要尋求控制 so when the physical mind seeks to control

  然後說：我想要這個，如果這個不發生，那一定是什麼地方出了問題 and says well I want this and if this doesn't happen then something must be wrong

  然後你其實是關上了高我可以給你比物質頭腦能夠想像得到的更好的東西的大門 then you are actually closing the doors through which the higher mind could give you something better than the physical mind was capable of imagining

  因此你實際上是在欺騙自己 and thus you are actually shortchanging yourselves

  但也要記住的是，每一件事物都處在它自己的存在狀態 but the idea also to remember is that every single thing is its own state of being

  想要某樣東西正是如此 and the idea of​​ wanting something is exactly that

  那是一種缺乏的狀態 it is a state of wanting

  那不是一種擁有的狀態 it is not a state of having

  所以如果你堅持想要、想要、想要的話 so if you insist on wanting wanting wanting

  你會一直處於一種想要的狀態 you're going to remain in a state of wanting

  那你就不能夠真正擁有，真正顯化，真正去體驗 and you're not actually going to be able to have, to really manifest, to experience

  焦點是在你的缺乏上面 the focus of your wanting

  因為你所做的只是說你想要它 because all you're doing is saying you want it

  因此，你繼續做的只是停留在想要的狀態 and therefore you will continue do nothing but stay in a state of wanting it

  於是它永遠不會出現 and it will never arrive

  這是另一個理解想要並不一定是你的最佳利益的原因 that's another reason to that wanting is not necessarily in your best interest

  但是需求是 but needing is

  此外當你發現自己身處某種境遇中 now the idea is that when you again find yourself in circumstances

  你可能會發現自己對正在發生的事情感到困惑，還有我真正需要的是什麼 and you might find yourself being confused about what's going on and what do I really need here

  來真正讓自己在生活中前進 to really allow myself to move forward in life

  來真正按照我的激情去行動，盡我最大的能力 to really act on my passion to the best of my ability

  不執著任何的結果 with no insistence on an outcome

  我在生活中真正需要的是什麼才能成為我真正的自己 what do I really need in life to be who I really am

  來讓我的人生以可能的最快樂的方式成長、擴展 to allow my life to grow to expand in the most joyful possible way

  我到底需要的是什麼？ what do I really need

  所以在這個傳訊中，我們已經把它分為七個基本的需求 so in this transmission we have broken it down for you to the seven basic needs

  我們把它們叫做中性需求 now we call them the neutral needs

  因為這些是你在生活中生存所需的基本的東西 because these are the basic things you need to survive in your life

  沒有太多你必須賦予給它們的意義 the idea is not so much that you have to assign a meaning to them

  這就是為什麼我們稱它們為中性 which is again why we call them neutral

  它們以某種方式自動運行 they function automatically in a certain way by themselves

  雖然你當然可以給它們帶上你的信念系統 although you can certainly color them with your belief system

  並賦予它們不同的含義，不同的情感和不同的定義等等 and imbue them with different meanings and different emotions and different definitions and so forth

  但它們本身只是基本需要，是你在物理現實體驗中生存所必須的 but by themselves they are just the basic fundamental needs that are required for you to exist in your physical reality experience

  任何時候當你發現自己陷入了某種境遇 and anytime you find yourself caught up in any kind of circumstance

  你發現自己在尋思處於什麼樣的狀態對你來說是最有益的 where you find yourself wondering what kind of state of being is really most beneficial for you to be in

  你隨時都可以使用這七個中性的需求回到「基態」 you can always use these seven neutral needs to go back to a ground state

  回到基本狀態 back to a fundamental state

  然後從零開始，從頭再來 and start again from zero, start again from scratch

  在很多情況下都要認識到這一點 and recognize that in many circumstances

  你真的得到了你需要的東西 you really are getting what you need

  通過專注在這7個中性的需求 and by focusing on the seven neutral needs

  它還可以協助和幫助你理解在那一刻你真正需要的東西 it can also aid and assist you in understanding the difference between what you may really need in that moment

  與相對的你在那一刻你想要的東西之間的區別 as opposed to what you are saying you want in that moment

  它可以作為你的一個澄清系統 and it can act as a clarifying system for you

  七個中性的需求，我們會說有著相關聯的不同的時間框架 now the seven neutral needs shall we say have different timeframes associated to them

  因為它們是你們體驗你們的物理現實所真正需要的東西 because they are things you really do need to experience your physical reality

  你會發現它們中有一些是你一直需要的 you will find that some of them you need all the time

  有些可能需要數週才能意識到你需要它 some of them can take weeks before you realize you need it

  有些可能需要很多年才能意識到你需要它 some of them can take years before you realize you need it

  但你真的都需要它們 but you really need them all

  如果沒有它們，你要麼會很快死去，要麼會慢慢死去 the idea is that without them you will either quickly or slowly die

  那樣你就知道它們實際上是基本需求 that's how you know they are actually fundamental needs

  那些花費數年的在某種意義上可能會產生誤解 the ones that take years in a sense can seem misleading

  因為你可能會覺得：嗯，我還好，我還在呼吸，我還在前進 because you might feel: well, I'm still fine, I'm still breathing, I'm still moving along

  所以你可以自欺欺人地認為你不需要它 and so you can fool yourself into thinking you don't need it

  或者你在以一種不符合需求的方式改變它 or that you are altering it in a way that is not really in alignment with the need

  但是，我們要說的是，急需和長期需求之間的區別，只不過是你隨著時間很快地死去或者慢慢地死去之間的區別but nevertheless all we're saying is the difference between the needs that are quick and the needs that take longer is just that you either die quickly or you die slowly over time

  當我們說死的時候 and when we say die

  我們也說的是你的能量，你的精神，你活下去的意願 we are also talking about the idea of​​ your energy your spirit your willingness to live

  你的歸屬感 your feeling that you belong

  你的適應感 your feeling that you fit

  你的賦權感 your feeling that you are empowered

  這些東西帶上負面信念的話，人就會慢慢枯萎像死了一樣 these things with negative beliefs can over time wither in a sense and appear to die

  久而久之導致你慢慢地死去 causing you to slowly die over time

  其實你可以過著更有活力的生活，更積極的生活 when you could be living a more vibrant life, a more energetic life

  那麼7個中性需求是什麼呢？ so what are the seven neutral needs

  謝謝，我們很高興你們這麼問 thank you, we're glad you asked

  以如果你沒有它們，會殺死你自己的時間順序來排列 in order of how long they take to kill you, if you don't do them

  我們從你們需要空氣開始 we start with you need air

  如果你沒有空氣，你很快就會死去 if you don't have air you will be dead pretty soon

  幾分鐘之內 within a matter of minutes

  所以這是最快的一個 so that's the quickest one

  你需要空氣來在你們的物理現實中生存 you need air to live in your physical reality

  下一個，你需要水來生活在你們的物理現實中 next you need water to live in your physical reality

  沒有水，你可能會在一週內死去 without water you will probably die in about a week

  這就有點長了 so that's a little longer

  接下來，許多人可能會想，接下來我需要食物 next now many who may be thinking well next I need food

  這不是下一個 that's not the next thing

  下一個，你需要睡覺 next you need sleep

  你需要做夢，你需要重新連接到靈魂 you need to dream, you need to reconnect to spirit

  這就是睡覺的目的 that's what's sleeping is for

  這就是做夢的內容 that's what dreaming is about

  你需要重新給你的物理電池充電 you need to re-energize your physical battery

  沒有睡眠，你只會存活11天左右 without sleep you will only last about 11 days

  然後你會死，與世長眠 and then you will die and sleep a lot longer than you intended to

  下一個是食物 next is food

  一般而言，你需要食物 you need food in general

  在我們繼續之前請理解 now please understand before we go on

  當然，總是會存在一些例外 of course there are always some exceptions

  有些人的狀態可以食氣，等等 there are people who are of a state where they can be breatharians and so on and so forth

  他們看起來好像可以長時間不需要進食 and they may seem to not need food for longer periods of time

  我不是在說例外情況 I'm not talking about the exceptions

  我說的是你們星球上的普通大眾 I'm talking about the general populace on your planet

  所以一般來說，你需要某種形式的食物，不然你會發現在兩到三週內你會開始死亡so in general you need sustenance of some form or you will find in about two to three weeks you will start to die

  下一個是什麼呢？ now what's next

  這些是發生得非常迅速的四個主要需求 those are the four main ones that happen pretty rapidly

  現在我們進入一個新階段，事情可能需要幾個月甚至幾年 now we enter a new phase where things can take months or years

  接下來，你需要某種形式的住所 so what is next is you need some form of shelter

  當我們說住所的時候，我們的意思並不是說它必須是一棟建築或一棟房子 now when we say shelter, we don't necessarily mean it has to be a building or a house

  你周圍的環境可以是你的庇護所 your environment can be your shelter

  如果這是一種你可以茁壯成長的環境 if it is the kind of environment in which you can thrive

  比如，你們星球上有人可能住在熱帶小島上，那裡的天氣一直都很好 so for instance people on your planet who might live on a tropical isle where the weather is always fine

  我們會發現這個庇護所夠用了 we'll find that that will be shelter enough

  他們不一定要住在傳統意義上的住宅裡 and they won't necessarily have to live in a dwelling in the classical sense

  但你需要某種形式的庇護所，即使它只是對你有益的周圍環境 but you need some form of shelter even if it is simply your environment that is beneficial to you

  那仍然是一個庇護所，自然的庇護所，地球的庇護所，符合維繫人類形態的生存that is still a shelter, the shelter of nature, the shelter of Earth, that is in accord and in alignment with the human form to sustain it

  接下來，你需要某種形式的連接、關係 next you need some form of connection relationship in some way

  我知道有時候人們可能會在旅途中獨自度過漫長的時光 I understand that sometimes people may be on journeys where they seem to spend a long time alone

  但這並不意味著他們沒有在真正的關係之中 but that doesn't mean they're not in a real relationship

  這種關係不一定要和其他人在一起 the relationship doesn't have to be with other human beings

  可以和動物在一起，也可以和樹在一起 it can be with animals, it can be with trees

  它可以和精神一起，可以和石頭一起，可以與神同在 it can be with spirit, it can be with a rock, it can be with God

  但這是一種關係 but it's a relationship

  你與生命，與大自然有著某種連接 you have some sense of connection to life, connection to nature

  與存在和靈魂有著連接 connection to existence and spirit

  與你的本質和存在有著連接 connection to your essence and your being

  你與一切萬有有著某種形式的表達聯繫 you have a relationship with all that is in some form of expression

  如果沒有這些，沒有這種聯繫，許多年之後你將會慢慢地死去 without that again it may take years but you will slowly die without that connection

  這又把你帶回睡覺狀態 which brings you back to the idea of​​ sleep

  因為這就是睡眠的作用就是為了建立那樣的連接 because again that's what the sleep is for to make that connection

  正如我們說過，在我們的世界上，我們不再進食，我們不再睡覺 now as we have said on our world we no longer eat we no longer sleep

  因為我們總是保持著連接，我們始終被支持著 because we are always connected we are always sustained

  只靠宇宙的能量，我們已經進化到了這一點 just by the energy of the universe we have evolved to that point

  最終你們也會的 and eventually you will too

  但是現在通常來說 but right now again as a generality

  你會發現你們大多數人都需要某種形式的關係 you will find that most of you need some form of relationship

  某種形式的連接 some form of connection

  某種形式的與意識的交流 some form of exchange with consciousness

  某種形式的反射可以讓你接觸到你所需的東西，讓你更成為自己 some form of reflection that allows you to get in touch with the things you need to be more of who you are

  你需要成長的東西 the things you need to grow

  這是真正的需要 this is a true need

  最後的需求是你們稱之為「創造性的表達」 the final need is what you might call creative expression

  換句話說，當你允許自己成為你自己的時候 in other words when you allow yourself to be who you are

  它必須被表達 it must be expressed

  這就是跟隨你的激情所在 this is where acting on your passion falls in

  這就是你表達造物的面向之一你自己所在 this is where you express the aspect of creation that you are

  你表達了你建立的連接 you express the connections that you've made

  你表達了維持你生命的能量 you express the energy that has sustained you in life

  所以你需要某種形式的個人的創造性表達 so you need some form of personal creative expression

  這對你是獨一無二的 that is unique to you

  這讓你知道，這讓你可以大喊你還活著 that allows you to know, that allows you to shout that you are alive

  這讓你閃耀，讓你的靈魂被重視 that allows you to shine, that allows your spirit to be counted

  被看見，被知道，被感知，被理解 to be seen, be known, to be felt, to be understood

  這些是七個中性的需求 those are the seven neutral needs

  還有後面的幾個 and again the idea of​​ some of the later ones

  比如沒有創造性地表達自己 like not expressing yourself creatively

  沒有表達，沒有用某種方式聲明你是誰，通過跟隨你的激情 not expressing not stating who you are in some way shape or form by following your passion

  如果你不這樣做，可能會花幾年時間殺死你自己 can take years to kill you if you're not doing it

  但你將會慢慢死去 but you will slowly be dying

  可能會有這樣的時期，當你經歷一個階段你並沒有那樣做，這沒關係 now again there may be moments when you go through phases where you're not doing it, that's fine

  因為這些階段存在於那裡也許會教給你一些東西 because again those phases may be there to teach you something

  只要你明白，跟隨你的激情工具箱裡的工具之一就是反射鏡 as long as you understand that one of the tools in the kit of following your passion is the reflective mirror

  這向你揭示了在你的潛意識中所持有的任何與你的真理不一致的東西 that reveals to you anything you might be holding on to in your unconscious mind that is out of alignment with your truth

  與你的需求不一致的東西 that is out of alignment with what you need

  然後允許自己去解決它 and you allow yourself to address it

  這就是重點，這就是經歷那時刻的目的，發現在一刻不屬於你興奮的東西 then that's the point, that's the purpose of having that moment of discovering something that is not your excitement in that moment

  因此你可以放手它，並把它的能量添加到你的整體興奮中 so that you can let it go and add its energy to your overall excitement

  然後以宏大的方式表達你自己 and express yourself in grander ways

  因此，反光鏡的矛盾之處在於 the idea therefore paradoxically of the reflective mirror

  當你跟隨你的興奮，向你揭示不屬於你的興奮那部分 while you're following your excitement revealing something to you that is not part of your excitement

  也是你興奮的一部分 is part of your excitement

  找出不讓你興奮的東西其實也是你興奮的一部分 to find out what doesn't excite you is part of your excitement

  因為當你生活中顯化出某種代表了你不喜歡的東西時 because when something manifests in your life that might be representative of what you don't prefer

  你可以積極地去使用它，通過意識到它在那是作為明確的指引，更加清楚讓你明白你不喜歡的東西是什麼you can use that in a positive way by recognizing that it might be there as a clarifying point to show you what you don't prefer much more clearly

  通過對比這樣你就能更清楚地知道你更喜歡什麼 so that you can see what you do prefer by contrast much more clearly

  這就是如何以你喜歡的方式去使用你不喜歡的東西 that's how to use what you don't prefer in a way that you do prefer

  所以你真實的表達，你存在的表達，通過跟隨你的激情，盡你所能 so again the expression of your truth, the expression of your being by following your passion to the best you're able

  不執著任何特定的結果 with no insistence on a particular outcome

  因為實際上你不知道到底應該會發生什麼 because you really don't know what's supposed to happen

  也許你認為你知道 you may think you do

  你就回到了負面的小我上了 but that's where you go back to the negative ego

  你就回到了小我認為它必須控制一切 that's where you go back to the idea that the ego thinks it has to control everything

  這就回到了「想要」上面 that's where you go back the idea of​​ wanting

  我想要這個發生，這必鬚髮生 I want this to happen, this has to happen

  這真的必鬚髮生，要不然就是哪裡出錯了 it's really gotta happen or something is wrong, something went wrong somewhere

  我偏離了我的軌道，其實不會的 I'm off my path, no

  你不可能偏離你的軌道 you cannot be off your path

  你就是你的道路本身 you are your path

  你能夠體驗到的好像你偏離你的道路的唯一方式就是 the only way you can experience as if you're off your path is

  假定你生活中發生的事情不可能出於積極的原因 by assuming that something that has happened in your life cannot possibly be there for a positive reason

  請記住 remember remember remember

  這是你需要記住的 this is what you need to remember

  發生什麼並不重要 it doesn't matter what happens

  唯一重要的是你如何處理所發生的事情 it only matters what you do with what happens

  這是關鍵，這就是秘密所在 that's the key, that's the secret

  但當你發現自己陷入了一個難題 but when you find yourself in a puzzle in a conundrum

  當你感覺像是已經忘記了 when you feel like you have forgotten

  只需回到這7個中性需求中 just go back to the seven neutral needs

  讓我想想 let's see

  「我還在呼吸，我過得很好」 I'm still breathing, I'm doing pretty good

  「單上的第一個我已經有了，勾掉」 I've got number one on the checklist, checked off

  「我已經很熟練了」 got that down pat

  「我需要一些水」 I need some water

  「好吧，我可能有點渴了，可能有點脫水" oh all right I might be a little thirsty might be a little dehydrated

  好吧，大口的喝 all right glug glug glug

  這點排除了 check that off your list

  "我需要睡一會兒，我覺得真的很累" I need to get some sleep I'm feeling really tired

  為什麼我很累？ why am I tired?

  我筋疲力盡了，因為我一直在努力成為別人，而不是我自己 I'm exhausted because I've been trying to be someone I'm not

  這是你能做的最累人的事情 which is the most tiring thing you can do

  所以我現在對休息很興奮 so I am now excited about resting

  休息，再生，連接，重新激活你的電池 rest, regenerate, connect, re-energize your batteries

  也許當你醒來的時候 now perhaps when you wake up

  你餓了 you are hungry

  找些食物 get some food

  填進你的肚子 put it in your body

  不管它是什麼，起什麼作用，傾聽你身體的意識 whatever it may be that works for you, listen to your body consciousness

  聽從你的直覺 listen to your intuition

  你不必強迫自己變得更靈性 you don't have to force yourself to be more spiritual

  是的，變得更輕更光亮很重要 yes, it's important to lighten up

  但是當你的能量處於更高的頻率時 but when your energy is on a higher frequency

  你會自動失去吃某些含有更沉重能量的東西的慾望 you will automatically lose the urge to eat certain things that might have a heavier energy

  沒有理由強迫自己這麼做 there is no reason to force yourself there

  這有點自相矛盾，然並卵 which is an oxymoron and it doesn't work anyway

  傾聽你的身體意識 listen to your body consciousness

  它知道你需要什麼 it knows what you need

  它知道你不需要什麼 and it knows what you don't need

  所以要注意這一點 so pay attention to that

  好了，前4個大項都核對了 then all right, got that all checked off those first four Biggies

  現在輪到了庇護所 and now some shelter

  你在讓你感到興奮的環境中嗎？ the idea of​​ are you in the environment that excites you?

  因為記住當我們談論做那些最讓你興奮的事情，跟隨你的激情並付諸行動時 because remember when we talk about doing what excites you the most and following your passion and acting on it

  它必須是一個完整的東西，一個整體的東西 it has to be a complete thing, a holistic thing

  做讓你興奮的事，以讓你興奮的方式 doing what excite you, in the way it excites you

  在讓你興奮的地方，和讓你興奮的人一起 how it excites you, where it excites you, with whom it excites you

  會自動地給予你，同步性地引導你到最具代表性的地方 will automatically allow your synchronicity to lead you to the place that is most representative

  會給你帶來你所需要的庇護所或環境 that will bring you the form of shelter or environment that you need

  讓你成為真正的自己，並繼續成長 to allow you to be who you really are and continue to grow

  還有「連接」 and also the idea of​​ connection

  同樣，它會同步地將所有真正最能代表你需要與之建立連接的任何類型的存有帶進你的生活中it will again synchronistically bring into your life all those of whatever type of being that really is most representative of the connections you need to make

  從而發現更多的關係，更多的你自己，更多的反射率和更多你需要的信息來增加你對你的存在和你此生探索的主題的瞭解in order to discover more relationship more about yourself more reflectivity more information that you might need to add to your understanding of your being and your theme of exploration in this life

  幫助你成長和擴展 and help you grow and expand

  進而最終表達你是誰和你是什麼 and then finally yes the expression of who and what you are

  你人生的目標就是盡你所能地做好自己 your purpose in life is to be you as best as you possibly can

  這是你的目的 that's your purpose

  你們人生目標的表達會跟很多人一樣是各不相同的 the expression of your purpose will be as different as there are as many people

  因為那隻是你目標的表達 because that's just an expression of your purpose

  你的激情便是你人生目標的表達 your passion is the expression of your purpose

  你激情的頻率，你激情的振動是你真正的自己 but the vibration the frequency of your passion is who you actually are

  是你存在的頻率，是你的本我 is your frequency of existence; is your essential self

  所以表達你自己，按照你的激情去行動，盡你最大的能力，不執著結果 so expressing yourself, acting on your passion, to the best you're able, with no insistence

  因此，你不會再次陷入「想要」之中，想要並不一定與你真正的需要相一致so you don't get caught up again in that idea of​​ wanting which isn't necessarily aligned with what you truly need

  如果所有這些要點你都對上了 and if you can check all those off

  你做的很好，你真的做了所有你需要做的 you're doing pretty good, you're really doing all you need to do

  你確實盡力了 you're really doing the best you can

  你可以開始放輕鬆了，生活將會自動運轉 and you can start relaxing into the idea that life works automatically

  你可以開始讓同步性以積極的方式為你工作，而不是消極的方式 you can start allowing synchronicity to work for you in positive ways rather than negative ways

  因為請記住同步性總是在起作用 because remember synchronicity is always working

  一直都是，它永遠不會停止 always, it never stops

  但也有消極的同步性 but there is negative synchronicity

  當你相信了消極信念，基於恐懼的信念 and when you buy into negative beliefs fear-based beliefs

  那麼你便是用負能量給機器餵食 then you are feeding the machine with negative energy

  於是它只能產生負面的同步性 and it can only produce negative synchronicity

  要讓事情發生或者不發生，這會使負面同步性的惡性循環繼續延續下去 and allow the things to happen or not happen that will continue to perpetuate the idea of​​ the downward spiral of negative synchronicity

  但是當你給它注入正能量並保持在正面的振動狀態時 but when you feed it the positive energy and stay in the positive vibratory state

  不管發生什麼事，不管它看起來如何 no matter what's going on, no matter how it looks

  你在供給機器正能量，這會讓你以積極的方式體驗到同步性 you are feeding the machine with the positive energy that will allow you to experience synchronicity in the positive way

  這只是物理現象，你給出什麼就得到什麼 this is just physics, what you put out is what you get back

  因為物理現實不是真實的 because physical reality isn't real

  它只是一面鏡子，它只是你意識的投射 it's just a mirror, it's just a projection of your consciousness

  所以，總是讓自己回到這些中性的立場 so allow yourselves to always go back to those neutral places

  讓自己意識到你已經有了你需要的東西 allow yourself to recognize that you have what you need

  如果你發現自己又「想要」了 and if you're going to find yourself wanting

  那麼至少是想要你所需要的 then at least want what you need

  沒有別的了 and nothing else

  因為除了你的真正需求，你還需要什麼 because what else do you need but what you truly need

  這輩子你來的時候已經帶來了你所需要的一切 you already come in with everything you need

  它並不總是顯現出來，你並不總是馬上就能看到它 it's not always manifest, you don't always see it right away

  因為這些東西的出現和展開是有時間點的 because there is a timing to the unfolding and the appearance of these things

  所有這些時間點已經內嵌在那了 but all that timing is baked in

  它就在你的身邊 it's there right here with you

  你沒必要強迫它 you don't have to force it

  它會在完美的時機發生 it will happen in perfect timing

  這就是它被設計成的方式 that's the way it's designed

  這就是它被構造成的樣子 that's the way it's structured

  所以請記住，你們星球上的很多人都在談論臣服，順其自然 so remember remember many people on your planet talk about the idea of​​ well, surrender to it, surrender to the flow

  很多人因為你們被教育成這樣相信 and many people because of the way you've been taught to believe things

  認為臣服意味著放棄控制 think oh surrender well that means I'm giving up control

  不是的，臣服只是放棄你早已內置的控制 No! surrender is simply giving over to the control you already have built in

  臣服就是放棄小我認為必須控制一切的想法 surrender is giving up on thinking that the ego has to control everything

  小我要做的所有事情就是讓你專注於你的物理體驗，然後偶爾湊湊熱鬧 all the ego has to do is keep you focused in your physical experience and go along for the ride

  這就是它被設計出來的全部目的 that's all it's designed to do

  這就是它需要做的一切 that's all it needs to do

  不要帶給小我超過它設計之初承受力之外的負擔 don't burden the ego with more than it was designed to handle

  否則它會開始變得有點古怪 otherwise it starts getting a little bit crotchety

  然後它變成了消極的小我 and it turns into the negative ego

  「哦，你想讓我來處理這個，哦，好吧」 oh you want me to handle that oh okay

  「哦，等下，這個也要」-「好吧」- oh wait I have to have this too oh all right

  「現在這個我也要讓它發生」 now I have to make that happen

  「哦，我開始不太喜歡你了」 oh I'm beginning not to like you very much

  所以我要開始向你耍一些卑鄙的伎倆 so I'm gonna start playing some dirty tricks on you

  我要讓你覺得你需要擁有這個，其實它只是一個想要而已 and I'm gonna make you think that you need to have this when it's just a want

  看你喜不喜歡 see if you like it

  你讓我背鍋，我也讓你背鍋 when I overburden you with the things you've overburdened me with

  是的，小我知道如何玩這遊戲 yes, the ego knows how to play that game

  所以，讓小我來做它自己的工作吧：簡單地體驗你的生活 so let the ego do its job of simply experiencing your life

  讓你聚焦於物理現實的體驗 allowing you to have focused to its experience of physical reality

  因為請記住，這個聚焦就是小我的全部意義 because remember that focus is all it is

  它只是自我強加的一個特別的視角，讓你體驗到一種叫做物理現實的東西，就好像它是真實的一樣it's just an imposition on yourself of a particular point of view that allows you to experience something called physical reality as if it was real

  它不是真的 it's not

  可以說你的自然狀態是非物質的，你的自然狀態是精神的 your natural state is non-physical so to speak your natural state is spirit

  你從未離開過靈性實相 you never leave spirit ever

  你只是在做夢你離開了靈性實相 you're just dreaming that you have left spirit

  你在靈性實相裡做著你不在靈性實相的夢 you are having a dream in spirit that you're not in spirit

  這就是物理現實，它只是一個焦點，同樣，當你睡覺的時候做夢 that's what physical reality is, it's just a focus in the same way that when you go to sleep and you have a dream

  它看起來很真實 and it seems very real

  然後你起床了 and then you wake up

  你會說：「哦，不管那感覺是多麼的真實，這才是我真正的自己」 and you go oh well no matter how real that felt this is who I really am

  不，那不是真的喲，其實這只是一個夢 well no, not really, this is actually the dream

  你只是睡著了 you've just gone to sleep

  當你晚上睡覺做夢的時候，那才是你真正醒來的時候 and when you go to sleep at night and you dream, that's when you actually have woken up

  因為在那個狀態下，你是更接近真正的自己 because you are more of yourself in that state

  更多的連接，更多的意識到你的靈性本質 more connected more aware to your spiritual essence

  這就是為什麼在夢中時間是沒有意義的 that's why time doesn't make sense in dreams

  因為在靈界，時間是可塑的，是有彈性的，它並不以同樣的方式存在 because in the spirit realm time is that malleable that flexible it doesn't really exist in the same way

  因為它只是作為你夢的一部分存在 because it's just part of your dream that it exists

  時間只是你意識的一個副作用 time is just a side effect of your consciousness

  以某種方式體驗事物 experiencing things in a certain way

  這樣你們就可以有你們稱之為物理現實的體驗 so you can have the experience you call physical reality

  其實只是你意識中的一個夢而已 which is just a dream within your consciousness

  懂了嗎？ is this making some sense?

  恩 yes
